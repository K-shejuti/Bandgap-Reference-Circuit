# Bandgap-Reference-Circuit
This github repository is for the design of a Band Gap Reference Circuit (BGR) using Google-skywater130nm technology PDK.
# Introduction to BGR
The Bandgap Reference (BGR) is a circuit which provides a stable voltage output which is independent of factors like temperature, supply voltage.
